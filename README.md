.bashrc and .inputrc are for Git Bash, can just paste it wherever ~ points to.

posh.omp.json is a template for oh my posh terminal, can be ran with: `eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash --config ~/posh.omp.json)"` in a .bashrc or similar config file, can be used in powershell too. 

`rider` needs to go wherever `rider64.exe` is so that when you add it to the PATH env variable you can just invoke "rider" in the command line

The powershell profile is to be placed under `Documents\PowerShell` or wherever `$PROFILE` is.
